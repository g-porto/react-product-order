# React Product Order App

🚧 **Work in Progress**

This project aims to rebuild a private HubSpot app I developed at work, adapting it for a standalone React environment.  
The goal is to replicate key functionality — such as product selection, order creation, and data handling — using public APIs instead of HubSpot's private API.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Practice advanced React concepts (state management, data fetching, and form handling)  
- Recreate real-world business logic outside of the HubSpot ecosystem  
- Explore integration with a free/public API for product data  

### 🛠️ Tech Stack (planned)
- React + Vite  
- TypeScript  
- REST APIs  
- Styled Components or CSS Modules
